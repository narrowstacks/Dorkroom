## Context7

Always running.

### Context7 Core Approach

- **Documentation-first development**: Reference official documentation through Context7 before implementing new patterns or features
- **Library research workflow**: Use `resolve-library-id` followed by `get-library-docs` to access up-to-date documentation and code examples
- **Problem-solving resource**: When encountering library-specific issues, Context7 should be the first resource for current solutions and workarounds

### Context7 Workflow Pattern

- **Library identification**: Start with `resolve-library-id` to find the correct Context7-compatible library identifier for any package or framework
- **Documentation retrieval**: Use `get-library-docs` with specific topics when possible to get focused, relevant documentation
- **Integration verification**: Verify compatibility and version requirements using Context7 before package updates or new integrations

### Context7 Key Tools

- **`resolve-library-id`**: Convert package names to Context7-compatible identifiers for documentation lookup
- **`get-library-docs`**: Fetch comprehensive, up-to-date documentation with optional topic focusing and token limits

### Context7 Best Practices

- **Preferred for dependency research**: Before adding new packages or updating existing ones, use Context7 to understand current best practices and API changes
- **Library-specific guidance**: For complex integrations (React, Next.js, TypeScript, testing frameworks), Context7 provides authoritative documentation and examples
- **Performance optimization**: Consult Context7 for performance optimization techniques specific to your technology stack

### Context7 Capability

- **Real-time documentation access**: Get the most current documentation and examples directly from official sources
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Access documentation for thousands of popular libraries and frameworks
- **Focused retrieval**: Target specific topics within large documentation sets for efficient information gathering

## Clear-Thought

Always running.

### Clear-Thought Core Approach

- **Systematic problem decomposition**: Use structured thinking tools to break down complex problems into manageable components
- **Multi-perspective analysis**: Apply various mental models and reasoning frameworks to approach problems from different angles
- **Iterative refinement**: Use sequential thinking and debugging approaches to refine solutions through multiple iterations

### Clear-Thought Workflow Pattern

- **Problem analysis**: Start with `sequentialthinking` for complex tasks requiring step-by-step breakdown
- **Decision making**: Use `decisionframework` for structured evaluation of options and trade-offs
- **Debugging workflow**: Apply `debuggingapproach` for systematic issue identification and resolution
- **Creative exploration**: Use `creativethinking` for brainstorming and innovative solution development

### Clear-Thought Key Tools

- **`sequentialthinking`**: Break down complex problems into ordered, manageable steps with branching and revision capabilities
- **`debuggingapproach`**: Apply systematic debugging methodologies (binary search, divide and conquer, root cause analysis)
- **`decisionframework`**: Structure decision-making with frameworks like pros/cons analysis, decision matrices, and risk assessment
- **`mentalmodel`**: Apply proven thinking frameworks (first principles, opportunity cost, Pareto principle, Occam's razor)
- **`collaborativereasoning`**: Simulate multiple expert perspectives for comprehensive problem analysis
- **`scientificmethod`**: Apply rigorous hypothesis-driven inquiry for complex investigations

### Clear-Thought Best Practices

- **Use for big/complex tasks**: When tackling large features, refactoring, or complex problem-solving, leverage sequential thinking systematically
- **Architecture decisions**: Apply structured frameworks for significant architectural changes or technology integrations
- **Multi-step development**: Use sequential thinking when developing complex algorithms or multi-component systems
- **Debugging complex issues**: Use structured approaches for multi-layered bugs or performance problems
- **Code review preparation**: Apply systematic thinking to review large changesets or complex features

### Clear-Thought Capability

- **Structured reasoning**: Transform chaotic problems into organized, solvable components
- **Multiple thinking modes**: Access various cognitive approaches for different types of challenges
- **Session persistence**: Maintain thinking context across interactions for complex, multi-session problems

## Playwright

Not always running, only use when user asks for web version help. If not running when user needs web help, stop what you're doing and ask user to turn Playwright MCP server on.

### Playwright Core Approach

- **End-to-end testing focus**: Use Playwright for comprehensive UI testing and user workflow validation
- **Browser automation**: Leverage Playwright's cross-browser capabilities for thorough testing coverage
- **Real user simulation**: Create tests that mirror actual user interactions and behaviors

### Playwright Workflow Pattern

- **Test environment assumption**: All tests assume development server is running at expected URL (typically localhost)
- **Cross-platform validation**: Test across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports systematically
- **User journey testing**: Focus on complete workflows from user entry to final output
- **Responsive behavior verification**: Ensure interfaces work correctly across different screen sizes

### Playwright Key Tools

- **Browser context management**: Create isolated browser contexts for clean test environments
- **Element interaction**: Use robust selectors and wait strategies for reliable element interaction
- **Screenshot and visual testing**: Capture visual states for regression testing and debugging
- **Network interception**: Monitor and mock network requests for comprehensive testing scenarios

### Playwright Best Practices

- **No server management**: Focus tests on UI interactions, not server lifecycle management
- **Robust selectors**: Use data attributes or role-based selectors over fragile CSS selectors
- **Wait strategies**: Implement proper waiting for dynamic content and async operations
- **Test isolation**: Ensure tests can run independently without side effects
- **Error handling**: Include comprehensive error scenarios in test coverage

### Playwright Capability

- **Multi-browser testing**: Validate functionality across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Mobile simulation**: Test responsive designs and touch interactions
- **Performance monitoring**: Measure and validate application performance metrics
- **Accessibility testing**: Verify WCAG compliance and screen reader compatibility

## Serena

Always running.

**Important:** At the start of any session, run activate_project with parameter `DorkroomReact` and then run `initial_instructions`.

### Serena Core Approach

- **Core approach**: Use the language server protocol (LSP) tools for symbol-level understanding rather than text-based analysis. Search for symbols by name/type using `find_symbol`, examine code structure with `get_symbols_overview`, and navigate relationships with `find_referencing_symbols`/`code_snippets`.

### Serena Workflow Pattern

- **Workflow pattern**: Start by reading project memories and performing onboarding if needed. Use `find_symbol` and overview tools to understand codebase structure. Edit at symbol level with `replace_symbol_body` or `insert_before`/`after_symbol` rather than line-based operations when possible. Execute tests/commands to verify changes and self-correct.

### Serena Key Tools

- **Key tools**:
  - Active tools: `activate_project`, `check_onboarding_performed`, `delete_memory`, `find_file`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `find_symbol`, `get_current_config`, `get_symbols_overview`, `initial_instructions`, `insert_after_symbol`, `insert_before_symbol`, `list_dir`, `list_memories`, `onboarding`, `prepare_for_new_conversation`, `read_memory`, `remove_project`, `replace_regex`, `replace_symbol_body`, `restart_language_server`, `search_for_pattern`, `summarize_changes`, `switch_modes`, `think_about_collected_information`, `think_about_task_adherence`, `think_about_whether_you_are_done`, `write_memory`
  - Excluded 6 tools: `create_text_file`, `read_file`, `delete_lines`, `replace_lines`, `insert_at_line`, `execute_shell_command`. **DO NOT USE THESE TOOLS, USE CURSOR NATIVE TOOLS**

### Serena Best Practices

- **Best practices**: Work from clean git state, create/read memories for context, use symbolic editing over line-based when possible, validate changes through testing, and split complex tasks across conversations using memories to manage context limits.

### Serena Capability

- **Capability**: The toolkit enables autonomous coding workflows from analysis through implementation to testing and version control.
