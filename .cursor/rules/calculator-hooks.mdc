# Calculator Hook Pattern

The application utilizes specialized custom hooks located in `app/hooks/` to encapsulate complex darkroom calculations.

**Pattern:**

1.  **State Management:** Hooks manage their own input state (e.g., paper size, desired stop change).
2.  **Calculation Logic:** They contain the core formulas and logic for a specific calculation (e.g., border sizing, exposure adjustment).
3.  **Return Values:** They return the calculated results and potentially helper functions or flags.

**Examples:**

- `useBorderCalculator.ts`: [app/hooks/useBorderCalculator.ts](mdc:app/hooks/useBorderCalculator.ts)
- `useResizeCalculator.ts`: [app/hooks/useResizeCalculator.ts](mdc:app/hooks/useResizeCalculator.ts)
- `useExposureCalculator.ts`: [app/hooks/useExposureCalculator.ts](mdc:app/hooks/useExposureCalculator.ts)
- `useCameraExposureCalculator.ts`: [app/hooks/useCameraExposureCalculator.ts](mdc:app/hooks/useCameraExposureCalculator.ts)
- `useReciprocityCalculator.ts`: [app/hooks/useReciprocityCalculator.ts](mdc:app/hooks/useReciprocityCalculator.ts)

Refer to these hooks when working on features involving darkroom printing calculations.
