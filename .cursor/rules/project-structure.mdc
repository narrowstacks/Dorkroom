# Dorkroom React Native Project Structure

This project uses Expo Router for file-based routing.

- **`app/`**: Contains all screens and routing logic.
    - **`(tabs)/`**: Defines the main tab navigation screens.
        - **`_layout.tsx`**: [app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx](mdc:app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx) configures the tab navigator.
        - Individual screen files (e.g., `index.tsx`, `border.tsx`).
    - **`hooks/`**: Custom hooks, including specialized calculators. See [calculator-hooks.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/calculator-hooks.mdc).
    - **`constants/`**: Shared constants like colors and data.
    - **`_layout.tsx`**: [app/_layout.tsx](mdc:app/_layout.tsx) is the root layout for the entire app.
- **`components/`**: Reusable UI components.
    - **`ui/`**: Components potentially from a UI library like Gluestack.
- **`assets/`**: Static assets like fonts and images.
- **`project-tracking/`**: Contains documentation files for project context and progress.
- **`App.js`**: Main entry point (often minimal with Expo).
- **`app.json`**: Expo configuration file.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Configuration for NativeWind.
