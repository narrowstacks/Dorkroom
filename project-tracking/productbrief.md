# Dorkroom React Native App - Product Brief

## Project Overview

Dorkroom is a React Native mobile application built with Expo, designed to provide a modern and efficient user experience. This document serves as the foundation for all project documentation and development efforts.

Dorkroom provides the users with helpful calculators for darkroom printing, film developing, photo shooting, and other photography related things. The main calculator the app is built around is the print border calculator, which helps users determine how to position the blades on their adjustable darkroom easels for the paper and aspect ratio combination they choose.
